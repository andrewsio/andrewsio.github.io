Hello! This is my personal website and blog, built using [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). 

The site theme is a fork from [LeNPaul's Lagrange](https://github.com/LeNPaul/Lagrange) which is liked the look of whem I moved away from Squarespace. You can read about that move in my [blog post](https://andrews.io/blog/moving-to-jekyll.html). Lagrance is a simple, clean theme which works well on both mobile and desktop. I've made a fair few customisations since then, including adding solution to allow for tags on pages, which is based on this [blog post](https://longqian.me/2017/02/09/github-jekyll-tag/).

My site is designed to be lightweight, low-cost, low-maintenance and with content written in Markdown for portability. The combination of Jekyll and GitHub Pages provides that and I think it's a pretty neat little setup. It doesn't have a CMS, and is tricky to use from mobile (although I did find a way to make it work), but I enjoy using an IDE on my desktop to write posts and push them. GitHub Pages is free, allows me to use my own domain and even runs the Jekyll build process when I make a commit. When making edits or writing new posts, I run Jekyll locally, before committing, which works nicely. 

I also host media and images on GitHub pages. To make this simpler, I have a script initiated by Apple Shortcuts to resize, rename, strip EXIF and convert images to jpeg. This was a recent addition, as of about 2025, where previsouly managing images was a complete PITA. This works quite well, and allows me to edit images in Apple Photos, then export them via Shortcuts and include in a post. 

Any questions, do get in touch!
