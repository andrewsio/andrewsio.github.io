We are incredibly fortunate in the UK, and particularly in London, to enjoy such a rich performing arts culture. Few things make me happier than an evening of good food, wine and the theatre. I have realised, however, that I do a poor job of keeping track of the productions I have seen, so this is my attempt to remedy that. I hope the list grows over time.

### The Lady from the Sea (2025)
Location: Bridge Theatre, London Bridge  
By: Henrik Ibsen, adapted by Simon Stone  
Key Cast: Alicia Vikander (Ellida Wangel), Andrew Lincoln (Dr Wangel)
Review: 

### Inter Alia (2025)
Location: Lyttelton Theatre, National Theatre, South Bank  
By: Suzie Miller  
Key Cast: Rosamund Pike (Jessica Parks)
Review: we sat on the second row, which meant we were incredibly close to cast. Rosamund Pike was outstanding, carrying the entire production on her shoulders. It was full of energy and you felt the emotion. I'm not surprised that this has been transferred to the West End. A very memorable experience.

### London Tide (2024)
Location: Lyttelton Theatre, National Theatre, South Bank  
By: Charles Dickens, adapted by Ben Power  
Key Cast: Ami Tredrea (Lizzie Hexam), Jamael Westman (Eugene Wrayburn), Scott Karim (Bradley Headstone), Tom Mothersdale (John Rokesmith)
Review: I was beyond excited for this and so pleased we were able to go. My first Dickens adaptation and it was really touching to be watching a performance written about the river from the South Bank. The music was the highlight and I was very pleased that it was later released.
