title: 👋 Hey! I'm Laurence
---

I am a dad, husband, technology guy, occasional blogger, ex-scuba diver and weekend sailor. I live in the English village of [High Halstow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Halstow) with my wife, Victoria, daughter, Charlotte and miniature dachshund, Dexter 🐶. This is my blog, where I post about all sorts of things, from [why I can't eat oysters](https://andrews.io/blog/so-long-oysters.html) to the time [I took a train to Turkey](https://andrews.io/blog/train-to-turkey-intro.html) and many other things in between. I don't really do the socials, because I think they're [bad for us](https://ledger.humanetech.com/), but you can find me on [<i class="fab fa-mastodon"></i>Mastodon](https://mastodon.world/@14zz4) if that's your thing.

When I'm not updating my blog, I work as a Solution Architect for the Canada-based, commercial real estate services company, [Colliers International](https://www.colliers.com) where I help turn ideas into projects and generally get things done. I have certificates in [TOGAF 9](https://andrews.io/blog/togaf9.html), Prince 2 and ITIL, among other things. My background is in computer networking and I have had the opportunity to lead and run projects for organisations such as [Cushman & Wakefield](https://www.cushwake.com/), [The Ministry of Justice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Justice_(United_Kingdom)), [The Department for Culture, Media and Sport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_for_Digital,_Culture,_Media_and_Sport), [Medway Council](https://www.medway.gov.uk/) and _(very briefly in 2012)_ even [The Olympic Delivery Authority](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/olympic-delivery-authority).

Outside of work I have lots of different passions and interests, if you have a poke around on the blog you'll get an idea of what I'm in too. Here's a quick list to get you started:
- ✈️**Travel**, I love to go to different places, here's the [countries I've visited](https://andrews.io/menu/countries.html)
- ⛵️**Sailing**, I enjoy dinghy and yacht [sailing](https://andrews.io/tag/sailing), especially on the River Medway
- 🤿**Scuba Diving**, I'm a PADI Tec45 and like my [scuba](https://andrews.io/tag/scuba) diving to be [deep, dark and scary](https://andrews.io/blog/padi-tec45.html)
- 🚂**Trains**, I am a bit of a train nerd, here's my [UK Rail Map](https://andrews.io/menu/railmap.html) and some [other blog posts](https://andrews.io/tag/trains)
- 📝**Writing Lists**, my [Bucket List](https://andrews.io/menu/thelist.html) is a long-term feature of the blog, seldom updated.
